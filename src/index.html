      <h3>Des Moines Highlights</h3>
      <p>Here are just some highlights of the many things Des Moines has to offer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <a href="http://www.desmoinesartcenter.org/visit/pappajohn-sculpture-park">
              Pappajohn Sculpture Park
            </a>:
            Open to visitors since September 2009, the Park features artwork by
            22 of the world's most celebrated artists.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 4.4 Acre park, located within a major crossroads of the urban
            grid, creates a pedestrian friendly entranceway to downtown Des
            Moines. This accessible setting, coupled with the skilled landscape
            design and caliber of the art, makes it unlike any other sculpture
            park in the United States. The Pappajohns' contribution of 28 works
            for the park is the most significant donation of artwork ever made
            to the Des Moines Art Center.
          </p>

        <li>
          <a href="https://eastvillagedesmoines.com/">
            East Village
          </a>:
          Des Moines's cutting edge, hip neighborhood, with shops, bars, music
          venues, etc. and the famous
          <a href="http://zombieburgerdm.com/">Zombie Burger</a> restaurant.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.desmoinesfarmersmarket.com/">
            Downtown Farmers Market
          </a> and the
          <a href="https://www.dmgov.org/Departments/Parks/Pages/PrincipalRiverwalk.aspx">
            River Walk
          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Downtown Court Street area including the
          <a href="http://www.hessenhaus.com/">Hessen Haus</a> and
          <a href="http://elbaitshop.com/">El Bait Shop</a>:
          <p>
            The Hessen Haus perfectly recreates the authentic atmosphere of an
            old-world German bier hall. The Fifty imported German biers on tap,
            authentic German fare on the menu, and sounds of live music on the
            stage&mdash;including local bands and regional polka&mdash;create a
            lively yet cozy atmosphere where large crowds gather to pass the
            boot and small groups find themselves making new friends.
          <p>
            With 185 beers on tap, El Bait Shop has the world’s largest
            selection of American Craft Beers.
